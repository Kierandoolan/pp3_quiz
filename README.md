## The Cash Quiz

The project is based on a general knowledge quiz.  Each question will have multiple choice answers that the user can pick. 
If the user picks the correct answer they will gain 100euro. If they answer wrong the cash remains the same.
At the end of the game they can see how much they have won. They will then have a choice to play again to see if they
can beat their last score and earn more money.

## Created the Heroku app

* I started with creating a _Config Var_ called `PORT`, and set this to `8000` in my Heroku page.  

* I created the app using following steps:  
* I added two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

* The importance here is to first have the Python, and after it the nodejs for it to work properly.

# Technologies used
